## Python continues..
function's recylability ==> make one function, use it milion times!  
basic def of recursive func ==> could possibly used as other options for iteration.  
python functions can actually pass mutiple values as return ==> very usefull in some situations.  

### var ... args from java in Python:
*args ==> makes the func to take multiple(not bound to a specific amount) variable  
      *==> gotta be careful when we go with *args since the values are taken as a tuple, so we better not make the parameters as a list or a tuple.(Since it is already a tuple)

### setting default parameter in def in python:
when you define default parameters for a function, than you must make sure that the follow up parameters must also be parameters with default value.  
ex: def function(a, b, c = ??, dd = ??) ==> works!!  
    def function(a, b=10, c, d) ==> DOES NOT work!!  
    
### assigning multiple valus
ex from calss:
def getInfo():
    return "hong", "gildong", 33
id, name, age = getInfo()
print(id, name, age)

## call back methiod  
Used as that of Javascript

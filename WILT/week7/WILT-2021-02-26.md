## Python continues..
function's recylability ==> make one function, use it milion times!  
basic def of recursive func ==> could possibly used as other options for iteration.  
python functions can actually pass mutiple values as return ==> very usefull in some situations.  

### var ... args from java in Python:
*args ==> makes the func to take multiple(not bound to a specific amount) variable
      *==> gotta be careful when we go with *args since the values are taken as a tuple, so we better not make the parameters as a list or a tuple.(Since it is already a tuple)

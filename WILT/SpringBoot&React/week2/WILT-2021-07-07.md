## Spring Security의 필터를 이용한 로그인:
유자에서 우리는 컨트롤러로 로그인을 진행했는데 강사님은 스프링의 시큐리티 필터 중 하나에서 로그인을 진행 하신다.  
on API Login Filter, we utilize email+pw collected and call for the authorization and produce token that client will send for all reqyests from that point on.   
With this approach we can minimize unnecessary calls to filters. ==> if we do logins with controller then it means we are going through all filters at all costs and then gets to 
controller and execute login while if we use filters to login we only get through filter and login and then user is free.   


## HttpOnly Cookie:
Cookie that is not accesible by JavaScript.  

## CORS problem with React:
In out last project, I've handled the problem with setting up a config about CORS, but this time we will be using filter to take of that problem.  


## JWT:
Json Web Token    
THe purpose of the token is an answer to the YES/NO question.  
As a consequence, e better be able to handle it as something containing trust worthy info with STATELESS state.  
===> leading to conclusion that we better try to avoid setting such a thing.   


## Stateless leading to functional programming.
OOP is not really a good fit for statelessness
